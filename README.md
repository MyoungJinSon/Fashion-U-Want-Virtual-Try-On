# Fashion-U-Want: High Resolution Virtual Try-On

Fashion-U-Want is a high-resolution virtual try-on system that leverages deep learning to overlay clothing onto a person's image. This framework processes input images through ``Try_TRYON.ipynb``, extracting clothing masks, pose information, and segmentation data to generate realistic try-on resultsâ€”all without requiring manual installation of dependencies.
